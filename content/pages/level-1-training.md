    subtitle: Ethical Breathplay is breathwork with a playful twist
    text: >
      Discover a sensual exploration of control, release, and embodied pleasure.
      Ethical Breathplay is tantalizing yet intentional, exhilarating yet
      grounded in safety and care. 


      By merging somatic principles with the art of breathplay, this practice
      becomes a pathway to connection, fulfillment, and the kind of satisfaction
      that lingers long after the breath returns.


      Ethical Breathpmay isn’t just about breath holding or breath control, it’s
      about discovery & **pleasure:** for trust, intimacy, and the playful power
      of what breath can do.
